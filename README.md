## Junior Data Analyst | Background in Technical Simulation & Visual Effects

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.

I am a Junior Data Analyst with over 7 years of experience working in the visual effects industry as a CFX Artist and Technical Animator. My professional background required deep analysis of variables, parameter tuning, and simulation optimization — skills that translate directly into structured data analysis and problem-solving.

After completing a Data Analytics Bootcamp (TripleTen), I developed hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization. I am currently building projects that demonstrate my ability to clean, analyze, and interpret real-world datasets.
